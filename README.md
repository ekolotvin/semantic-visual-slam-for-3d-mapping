# Integration-of-Semantic-Segmentation-into-Visual-SLAM-for-Autonomous-Driving
This project trains a DeepLabV3+ semantic segmentation model on KITTI, BDD_10K, and a unified dataset. Models are evaluated for cross-dataset generalization, and the best one is integrated into KITTI visual odometry to fuse 2D semantics with LiDAR, producing a semantic 3D map
